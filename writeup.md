### Deliverables

1. Writeup:
    a. Each team will submit a brief writeup (approx. 1-2 pages, PDF format)
summarizing their project, in which each student will describe and explain their
contribution. The writeup should include the following sections:
        i. Implementation of the model
        ii. Results (how your model performed with various hyperparameters + your
best model for the Kaggle competition)
        iii. Challenges (what was hard about the challenge/implementation)
        iv. Conclusion(what did you learn from this assignment)
        v. Individual Contribution (for each student, write briefly about what you
specifically did for this assignment)

2. Code:
    a. Submit a link to the single GitHub repository for the teamâ€™s project. Please add a
README with steps to reproduce your results. For example, you can include a
Jupyter notebook that runs from start to finish and/or instructions on how to run
your script.
